                <p class="is-family-secondary pl-6">There is a lot of things I like to do. First and certainly foremost, I have
                    a deep passion for the country of Iceland. I was opportuned to spend 2 years There
                    as a missionary and I have returned several times. It is difficult not to be
                    enamored with the stunning landscape, the beauty  and ruggedness that it possesses is
                    overwhelming. It is my love for Iceland that brought me to videography. There is, after all,
                    no greater place in the world to film. Whichever direction you look, there is something fantastic
                    just waiting to be captured. <br><br>
                    I also enjoy working with my hands. I am about to embark on the journey of home renovation and am excited
                    to finally have an excuse to purchase power tools. In the past I have refurbished an old beat up desk and 
                    would like to take the next step and build my own. <br><br>
                    In addition to travelling to Iceland, I deeply enjoying visiting new places. For me, it doesn't always have to 
                    be about the destination. I love the feeling of renewal that comes with being able to leave behind the everyday grind.
                    There is something transcendant about it.

                <p class="is-family-secondary pr-6">
                    When I'm not enjoying free time, I like to build web sites. As frustrating as it undoubtedly 
                    at this stage of my career, I deeply enjoy the satisfaction that comes with learning. Web devlopment
                    is a truly rewarding and satisfying field of work. <br><br>
                    Ultimately, I have the dream of owning my business and being the boss. Perhaps its simply in the blood, as
                    my father has always been an entrepreneur, but there is a tremendous allure to being ones boss that
                    makes the risk of loss worth the trouble to succeed. <br><br>
                    I see myself  parlaying my understanding of Web Development and my strong communication skills to creating 
                    a business that will have the legs to withstand the storms of unstable markets and economies.
